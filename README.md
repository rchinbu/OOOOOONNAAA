OONA

OONA is a game that has cards. It is similar to the game UNO but is not the same in that it is spelled “OONA” and is not copyrighted by Mattel. The way to win OONA is by playing the UNO the way everybody ACTUALLY plays, not by the point system.\nYou go around in a clockwise fashion, or numerically in this case, starting with the dealer (unless SKIP, REVERSE, DRAW2, or DRAW4 is played). The player lays down a card that matches either the number or the color of the one on top of the discard pile. If you don't have any valid cards, you automatically have to draw another. You will have the choice to put down the newly drawn card if it is valid. If not, it will simply get added to your hand. The first player to run out of cards is the winner!

You can play with either 2, 3, or 4 total players, all from different computers!

If you initialiaze/start a game, you must learn how to port forward if you are using a personal home router. http://192.168.1.1/ is the address you need to log into your router. Default log in information depends on the router, so you will need to look up what is appropriate for yours. If you have personalized log in credentials, use that instead. In most cases, the port forwarding is under the WAN tab upon log in, but you can follow more specific directions upon lookup for your router. Be sure that, when filling out the information, you use port 3000, as that is the port designed to work with this game. This website includes plenty of useful directions: https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/.

Have fun playing OONA!
